# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project
## Description:

This project is a final part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. It involved collecting and analyzing survey data from the "2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey", with the aim of identifying trends and insights in the technology industry. The data was cleaned and visualized using various techniques such as bar charts, heatmaps, hierarchical charts, etc.

## Technologies Used:

CDE (Cognos  Dashboard Embedded. It is a platform provided by IBM Cognos Analytics that allows developers to create and embed customized dashboards and visualizations into their applications. This enables end-users to access and interact with data in a more intuitive and user-friendly way, without having to navigate complex data sources or reporting interfaces)
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

## 
In addition to the Jupyter Notebook and Python code, I also created a PowerPoint presentation to showcase the project results and insights. The presentation is available in the 'capstone-story-template_F' file of this repository.
